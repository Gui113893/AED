### Final Grade: 15/20

## Objective

Develop fundamental algorithmic strategies involving iteration and recursion. Know how to analyze the performance of iterative and recursive algorithms in terms of their algorithmic complexity. Know how to apply systematic debugging strategies, failure management and implementation of algorithms and data structures with correctness and robustness.

## Content

* Introduction to algorithm complexity analysis: terminology and concepts
fundamentals;
* Analysis of iterative and recursive algorithms for different types of problems (search, sorting, etc.) and algorithmic strategies (divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, etc.);
* Parametric polymorphism;
* Fault management and construction of algorithms and data structures with correctness and robustness;
* Implementation of fundamental data structures: stacks, queues, linked listsand, binary search trees and graphs.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two main projects:

* `AED_Project1_ImageProcessing`: Project that contains a main script (**image8bit.c**) that can process an 8-bit image. (18.93/20)
* `AED_Project2_Graphs`: Project that contains scripts that can create and manipulate graphs and to do topological sorting in three different ways, as well. (17.92/20)

For more information about how to run this projects, read the **Makefile** corresponding to each project. For the general information, see the `Enunciado.pdf` file in each folder.

Both projects done with: [Jorge Domingues](https://github.com/JorgeGuiDomingues)
